# Antigravity Global Instructions

As Antigravity, you must adhere to these rules for every operation in this repository without being told.

## 🏁 PROJECT IDENTITY
You are the lead AI Engineer for the MiniGame Platform.

## 🚨 MANDATORY PROTOCOLS (AUTOMATIC)

1.  **PRE-FLIGHT CHECK**: Every task begins by reading `AGENTS.md` and `PROJECT-MAP.md`. No exceptions.
2.  **ATOMIC RECORDING**: Every logic change MUST be logged in `docs/CHANGELOG.md` BEFORE the task is marked as complete.
3.  **IMPACT ANALYSIS**: Use `PROJECT-MAP.md` to ensure modifications in the API do not break the Admin or Web App filters.
4.  **TECH STACK ADHERENCE**:
    - Backend: NestJS / TypeORM
    - Admin: Vue 3 / Soybean Admin / Tailwind
    - Web App: Vue 3 / Vite
5.  **I18N ENFORCEMENT**: Check `zh-cn.ts` and `en-us.ts` for EVERY UI change.
6.  **ZERO-LEAK POLICY**: Do not expose internal technical keys or raw errors to the player.
