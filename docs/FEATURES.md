## 🎨 Game Instance Theme Preset System

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** Live ✅

### 📍 Location
- **Config Form:** `apps/soybean-admin/src/views/games/game-instance/components/ConfigForm.vue`
- **Theme API:** `apps/soybean-admin/src/service/api/themes.ts` (`fetchThemes`)
- **Theme Storage:** Database `themes` table; loaded at mount via `loadThemes()`

### 🎯 Feature Description
Allows administrators to apply full visual preset packages (themes) to a Game Instance from a dropdown selector inside the Config panel. A selected theme instantly applies all its stored config keys to the form in real-time and syncs the live preview iframe. Any subsequent manual edit by the admin auto-resets the selector to "Custom" to prevent confusion.

### ⚙️ Core Mechanisms

#### 1. Theme Preset Application (Instant, Real-Time)
- Themes are fetched from the database on mount (`loadThemes()`) and stored in `dynamicThemes`.
- When `formModel.themePreset` changes (user picks a theme), a Vue `watch` fires **immediately**, iterating over all keys in `theme.config` and assigning them directly to `formModel`.
- A `postMessage({ type: 'sync-config' })` is sent to the preview iframe so the live preview updates instantly.
- **No save is required for the preview.** The settings are only persisted to the database when the admin clicks "Apply Changes".

#### 2. Priority Order for Presets
1. `formModel.templatePresets[themeName]` — Backend-injected presets embedded in the game template schema (highest priority).
2. `dynamicThemes[themeName]` — Themes fetched from the `themes` DB table.
3. `PRESETS[themeName]` — Legacy hardcoded presets (backwards compatibility fallback).

#### 3. Auto-Switch to Custom on Manual Edit
- An `isApplyingPreset` ref flag is raised to `true` before bulk-applying theme fields and lowered after 300ms.
- The `formModel` deep watcher checks this flag. If `false` and `themePreset !== 'Custom'`, it automatically sets `themePreset = 'Custom'`.
- This ensures the dropdown label is always honest — if the user has deviated from the theme, the selector shows "Custom" not the original theme name.

#### 4. Prize List Templates (Separate)
- `PRIZE_TEMPLATES` is a separate, hardcoded set of prize-list presets (Balanced, High Stakes, Everyone Wins, etc.).
- Selecting a prize template replaces only the `prizeList` array. It does not affect theme/visual settings.

### 🚨 Modification Impact Scope
- **Adding new theme fields**: New keys in a theme's `config` JSONB will be applied automatically. No frontend code change needed.
- **The 300ms guard**: If a preset bulk-applies many fields asynchronously, increase the timeout to prevent premature "Custom" switching.
- **Legacy PRESETS object**: The small hardcoded `PRESETS` map (`Neon Night`, `Gold Royale`, etc.) only sets 4 fields. Prefer using the DB themes system for full preset coverage.

## 📁 Standardized Asset Upload System

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-21
**Status:** Implementation Complete ✅

### 📍 Location
- **Upload Endpoint:** `apps/api/src/modules/game-instances/game-instances.controller.ts` — `POST /game-instances/upload`, `DELETE /game-instances/upload`
- **Theme Uploader:** `apps/soybean-admin/src/views/games/theme-detail/index.vue`
- **Instance Uploader:** `apps/soybean-admin/src/views/games/game-instance/components/ConfigForm.vue`
- **API Clients:** `apps/soybean-admin/src/service/api/themes.ts`, `management.ts`

### 🎯 Feature Description
A unified, consistent file upload and deletion pattern for all game assets (images, audio, fonts) across both the Theme Editor and Game Instance configuration panels.

### ⚙️ Core Mechanisms

#### 1. Namespaced Upload Paths
Files are stored in a predictable, structured directory hierarchy:
- **Common Themes:** `uploads/common-themes/[themeSlug]/[category]/[customName.ext]`
  - Example: `uploads/common-themes/candy-kingdom/backgrounds/bgImage.png`
- **Game Instances:** `uploads/[companyId]/[instanceId]/[category]/[customName.ext]`

The backend detects `common-themes` in the `instanceId` field and bypasses company-ID partitioning.

#### 2. Deterministic Filenames
The `customName` field in the upload `FormData` must be appended **before** the `file` field. Multer processes multipart form data sequentially, so sending the file binary first causes it to fall back to a random 32-hex-character UUID.

#### 3. Server-Side File Deletion
`DELETE /game-instances/upload` accepts `{ url }`, resolves the physical path from `/api/uploads/...`, applies path-traversal protection (`path.resolve()` + `startsWith(uploadsRoot)`), and deletes the file via `fs.unlinkSync()`.

#### 4. Cache-Busting
All GET endpoints for themes and game instances include `_t: Date.now()` to prevent browser XHR cache from surfacing stale config data (e.g., after clearing an image).

### 🚨 Modification Impact Scope
- **Adding new upload categories:** Add new `category` values to the frontend `triggerUpload()` calls. The backend creates directories dynamically.
- **Changing the path prefix:** The `/api/uploads/` constant is used by both the `DELETE` endpoint and all static asset serving. Changing it requires updating both `main.ts` (`useStaticAssets`) and the delete endpoint.

## 🔄 JK Synchronization System

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-16  
**Status:** Optimization Complete ✅

### 📍 Location
- **Scheduler:** `apps/api/src/modules/sync/sync.scheduler.ts`
- **Processor:** `apps/api/src/modules/sync/sync.processor.ts`
- **Controller:** `apps/api/src/modules/sync/sync.controller.ts`
- **Admin UI:** `apps/soybean-admin/src/views/management/company/index.vue`
- **Events:** `apps/api/src/app.module.ts` (EventEmitter config)

### 🎯 Feature Description
A robust, multi-tenant background synchronization system designed to keep player data, deposits, and withdrawals in sync with the JK Platform.

### ⚙️ Core Mechanisms

#### 1. Event-Driven Orchestration
- Uses `@nestjs/event-emitter` to decouple company updates from the sync engine.
- When an administrator saves new settings (Cron, Parameters, Toggles), a `sync.refresh` event is emitted.
- The `SyncScheduler` catches this event and immediately re-registers the BullMQ repeatable jobs for that specific company.

#### 2. Granular Per-Type Configuration
- **Independent Toggles**: Enable/Disable Member, Deposit, or Withdrawal sync separately.
- **Custom Cron**: Each sync type can have its own schedule (e.g., Members every 4 hours, Deposits every 5 minutes).
- **Custom API Parameters**: Add arbitrary key-value pairs (like `agent_id` or `source`) that are injected into the outgoing API requests.

#### 3. High-Performance Parallel Processing
- **Batch Syncing**: Fetches up to 30 pages of data in parallel to maximize throughput.
- **Incremental vs Full Mode**:
    - **Incremental**: Only fetches up to `maxPages` (e.g., last 200 pages) to save bandwidth.
    - **Full**: Iterates through all available data until completion.

#### 4. Reliability & Deduplication
- **Job ID Stability**: Uses stable IDs like `sync_member_{companyId}` to prevent duplicate schedules in BullMQ.
- **Upsert Strategy**: Automatically creates new players or updates existing ones based on external IDs, ensuring no data loss during sync.

### 🚨 Modification Impact Scope
- **Memory Usage**: Increasing `removeOnComplete` (currently 500) will increase Redis memory consumption.
- **API Rate Limits**: Batch size (currently 30) should be tuned based on the JK API's capacity to handle parallel requests.

## 🛡️ Tenant Isolation System

**Implementation Date:** 2026-02-14  
**Status:** Implementation Complete ✅

### 📍 Location
- **Scores Isolation:** `apps/api/src/modules/scores/scores.controller.ts`
- **Admin Scores Isolation:** `apps/api/src/modules/scores/admin-scores.controller.ts`
- **Admin Prizes Isolation:** `apps/api/src/modules/scores/admin-prizes.controller.ts`
- **Admin Members Isolation:** `apps/api/src/modules/members/admin-members.controller.ts`
- **Auth Strategy:** `apps/api/src/modules/auth/strategies/jwt.strategy.ts`

### 🎯 Feature Description
Ensures strict data segregation between different companies. An administrator or member from "Company A" cannot view or modify data belonging to "Company B".

### ⚙️ Core Mechanisms

#### 1. JWT Property Standardization
The application distinguishes between technical `companyId` (for members) and `currentCompanyId` (for administrators/staff):
- **Members:** Access scope is fixed to their `companyId`.
- **Admins:** Access scope is determined by `currentCompanyId`, allowing Super Admins to switch contexts while enforcing strict boundaries for regular staff.

#### 2. Explicit Ownership Check
All sensitive endpoints implement a manual check to verify that the resource being accessed belongs to the user's company:
```typescript
if (!req.user.isSuperAdmin && resource.companyId !== req.user.currentCompanyId) {
    throw new ForbiddenException('You do not have access to this resource');
}
```

#### 3. Forced Context Injection
For creation and listing operations, the authenticated user's `companyId` is automatically injected into queries, overriding any attempt to query other companies via parameters.

#### 4. Super Admin Bypass
Authorized Super Admins retain the ability to view all data by passing a `companyId` query parameter, which is only honored if `isSuperAdmin` is `true`.

### 🚨 Modification Impact Scope
- **CRITICAL:** Adding new controllers or modules MUST implement these checks.
- **SECURITY:** Any changes to `JwtStrategy` or `auth.service.ts` may affect isolation integrity.

## ⚡ High Performance Data Pattern (Standardized Pagination)

**Implementation Date:** 2026-02-20  
**Status:** Rollout Complete ✅

### 📍 Location
- **Backend Core:** `CompaniesService`, `RolesService`, `UsersService`, `PermissionsService`, `AdminScoresController`, `AdminPrizesController`
- **Frontend Core:** `service/api/management.ts`
- **Views:** `role/index.vue`, `user/index.vue`, `company/index.vue`, `permission/index.vue`, `scores/index.vue`, `prizes/index.vue`
- **Layout:** `apps/soybean-admin/src/views/management/` (shared flexbox patterns)

### 🎯 Feature Description
Standardizes all high-volume data lists with server-side pagination, keyword searching, and a robust flexbox-based layout that ensures navigation controls are always visible.

### ⚙️ Core Mechanisms

#### 1. Server-Side Pagination & Search
- All lists use `remote: true` in `NDataTable`.
- API calls pass `page`, `limit`, and `keyword` parameters.
- Backend services use TypeORM `createQueryBuilder` with `.skip()` and `.take()` for optimal SQL execution.

#### 2. Robust Flexbox Layout
- Uses a `flex-col` container with a `flex-1-hidden` card.
- `NDataTable` receives `flex-height`, allowing it to scroll internally while keeping the pagination footer fixed at the bottom of the visible area.
- Prevents the "disappearing pagination" bug on smaller screens or long lists.

#### 3. Database indexing
- Critical columns like `createdAt`, `companyId`, `emailHash`, and `username` have `@Index()` decorators.
- Ensures sorting and filtering remains sub-second even with millions of rows.

### 🚨 Modification Impact Scope
- **API Response Structure**: Most lists now return `{ items: T[], total: number }` instead of a raw array.
- **Internal Dependencies**: Specialized services (like `SyncScheduler`) that call `findAll()` must destructure the response or pass a high `limit`.

## 🎯 Game Rules System

**Implementation Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Implementation Phase:** Phase 1 + Phase 2 (High priority rules)

### 📍 Location
- **Main Service:** `apps/api/src/modules/scores/game-rules.service.ts`
- **Entities:**
  - `apps/api/src/modules/scores/entities/play-attempt.entity.ts`
  - `apps/api/src/modules/scores/entities/budget-tracking.entity.ts`
- **Integration Point:** `apps/api/src/modules/scores/scores.service.ts`
- **API Endpoint:** `GET /scores/status/:instanceSlug`

### 🎯 Feature Description

The Game Rules System is used to control players' game behavior, including attempt limits, time control, level requirements, etc. Rules are verified before users play to prevent abuse and control costs.

### ⚙️ Implemented Rules

#### 1. dailyLimit (Daily Attempt Limit)
- **Purpose:** Limit the maximum number of times each user can play per day.
- **Use Case:** Anti-farming, cost control, creating scarcity.
- **Config Field:** `config.dailyLimit` (number, 0 = no limit)
- **VIP Bonus:** Supports additional attempts for VIP members.
- **Error Code:** `DAILY_LIMIT_REACHED`

**Example Configuration:**
```json
{
  "dailyLimit": 3,
  "vipTiers": [
    { "name": "Gold", "extraSpins": 2, "multiplier": 1.5 }
  ]
}
```

**API Response:**
```json
{
  "code": "DAILY_LIMIT_REACHED",
  "message": "You have exhausted your daily attempts (3/day)",
  "resetAt": "2026-02-02T00:00:00Z",
  "remaining": 0,
  "limit": 3
}
```

#### 2. cooldown (Cooldown Period)
- **Purpose:** Users must wait X seconds after playing before they can play again.
- **Use Case:** Prevent rapid point farming, reduce server pressure.
- **Config Field:** `config.cooldown` (number, seconds, 0 = no cooldown)
- **Error Code:** `COOLDOWN_ACTIVE`

**API Response:**
```json
{
  "code": "COOLDOWN_ACTIVE",
  "message": "Please wait 45 seconds before playing again",
  "cooldownSeconds": 60,
  "remainingSeconds": 45,
  "canPlayAt": "2026-02-01T08:10:00Z"
}
```

#### 3. oneTimeOnly (Single Play Only)
- **Purpose:** Each user can only play once in their lifetime.
- **Use Case:** Newcomer welcome gifts, limited-time events, rare prizes.
- **Config Field:** `config.oneTimeOnly` (boolean, default: false)
- **Error Code:** `ALREADY_PLAYED`

#### 4. timeLimitConfig (Time Limit)
- **Purpose:** Limit the game to be open during specific time periods.
- **Use Case:** Limited-time events, weekend specials, business hours.
- **Config Field:**
  ```typescript
  timeLimitConfig: {
    enable: boolean;
    startTime: Date | null;  // Event start time
    endTime: Date | null;    // Event end time
    activeDays: number[];    // [0-6] 0=Sun, 1=Mon...
  }
  ```
- **Error Codes:** `NOT_STARTED`, `ENDED`, `INVALID_DAY`

**Example: Weekends Only**
```json
{
  "timeLimitConfig": {
    "enable": true,
    "activeDays": [0, 5, 6]
  }
}
```

### 🗄️ Database Tables

#### play_attempts (Game Attempt Records)
```sql
CREATE TABLE play_attempts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  member_id UUID REFERENCES members(id),
  instance_id UUID REFERENCES game_instances(id),
  attempted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  success BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  ip_address VARCHAR(45)
);
```

**Purpose:** Records every attempt to play a game, used to verify dailyLimit, cooldown, and oneTimeOnly rules.

#### members (New Fields)
```sql
ALTER TABLE members ADD COLUMN level INT DEFAULT 1;
ALTER TABLE members ADD COLUMN vip_tier VARCHAR(20);
ALTER TABLE members ADD COLUMN experience INT DEFAULT 0;
```

**Purpose:** Supports the leveling system and VIP privileges (minLevel and vipTiers rules).

#### budget_tracking (Budget Tracking)
```sql
CREATE TABLE budget_tracking (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  instance_id UUID REFERENCES game_instances(id),
  tracking_date DATE,
  total_cost DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0,
  play_count INT DEFAULT 0,
  UNIQUE(instance_id, tracking_date)
);
```

**Purpose:** Tracks daily/monthly prize costs, used for budgetConfig rules (Implemented in Phase 3).

### 🔗 Dependencies

**Depends on:**
- `PlayAttempt` entity - Game attempt records
- `Member` entity - User level and VIP information
- `GameInstance` entity - Game configuration

**Called by:**
- `ScoresService.submit()` - Validates rules before submitting scores
- `ScoresController.getGameStatus()` - Queries player eligibility status

### 🔧 Working Principle

#### Validation Flow
```
User clicks to play game
  ↓
Frontend: POST /scores/:instanceSlug
  ↓
ScoresController.submit()
  ↓
GameRulesService.validatePlay() ← Validates all rules
  ├─ checkTimeLimit()        ← Checks time limits
  ├─ checkOneTimeOnly()      ← Checks if already played
  ├─ checkDailyLimit()       ← Checks today's attempts
  └─ checkCooldown()         ← Checks cooldown timer
  ↓ (All pass)
ScoresService.submit()       ← Records the score
  ↓
GameRulesService.recordAttempt() ← Logs the attempt
  ↓
Return Result
```

#### Error Handling
If any rule validation fails, a `BadRequestException` is thrown, returning an error code and details:
```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "code": "DAILY_LIMIT_REACHED",
  "message": "You have exhausted your daily attempts (3/day)",
  "resetAt": "2026-02-02T00:00:00Z",
  "remaining": 0,
  "limit": 3
}
```

### 📊 Data Flow

#### 1. Validating Game Rules
```
Client → POST /scores/:instanceSlug
  ↓
GameRulesService.validatePlay(memberId, instance)
  ├─ Query play_attempts table (attempts today, last play time)
  ├─ Verify instance.config settings
  └─ If violation → throw BadRequestException
  ↓ (Success)
Proceed to execute submit()
```

#### 2. Querying Player Status
```
Client → GET /scores/status/:instanceSlug
  ↓
GameRulesService.getPlayerStatus(memberId, instance)
  ├─ Query attempts played today
  ├─ Calculate VIP bonus attempts
  └─ Return { canPlay, dailyLimit, played, remaining, resetAt }
```

#### 3. Recording Game Attempts
```
After submit() succeeds
  ↓
GameRulesService.recordAttempt(memberId, instanceId, true, ipAddress)
  ↓
Insert into play_attempts table
```

### 🐛 FAQs

**Q: How to test rules?**
A: Use Postman or curl to send POST requests:
```bash
# 1. Play game normally
curl -X POST http://api.xseo.me/scores/test-wheel \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"score": 10}'

# 2. Query status
curl http://api.xseo.me/scores/status/test-wheel \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# 3. Trigger daily limit (after playing 3 times)
# Should return DAILY_LIMIT_REACHED error
```

**Q: Why are my rules not working?**
A: Check the following:
1. ✅ Is this rule configured in the game instance config?
2. ✅ Is the rule value correct? (e.g., dailyLimit: 0 means no limit)
3. ✅ Has the API been restarted? (Code changes require restart)
4. ✅ Are the database tables created? (play_attempts, budget_tracking)

**Q: How to reset player game records?**
A: Directly delete records from the play_attempts table:
```sql
DELETE FROM play_attempts 
WHERE member_id = 'xxx' AND instance_id = 'yyy';
```

**Q: How to configure VIP extra attempts?**
A: Add vipTiers to the game instance config:
```json
{
  "dailyLimit": 3,
  "vipTiers": [
    { "name": "Bronze", "extraSpins": 0, "multiplier": 1 },
    { "name": "Silver", "extraSpins": 1, "multiplier": 1.2 },
    { "name": "Gold", "extraSpins": 2, "multiplier": 1.5 }
  ]
}
```

Then update the member's vip_tier field:
```sql
UPDATE members SET vip_tier = 'Gold' WHERE id = 'xxx';
```


#### ✅ Safe Modifications (No impact on other features)
- Adjust rule thresholds (e.g., dailyLimit, cooldown values).
- Add new VIP tiers.
- Modify error message text.

#### ⚠️ Requires Testing
- Modify GameRulesService validation logic.
- Add new rule methods.
- Modify play_attempts table structure.

#### 🔥 High Risk Modifications
- Modify ScoresService.submit() calling sequence.
- Delete recordAttempt() call (will invalidate rules).
- Modify play_attempts table primary keys or indexes.

- **API Error Codes:** `minigame/API.md` (To be created)
- **Troubleshooting:** `minigame/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

### ⚙️ Medium Priority Rules (Phase 3)

#### 5. minLevel (Level Requirements)
- **Purpose:** Only users who reach Level X can play
- **Use Case:** Game threshold, member privileges, prevent botting
- **Config Field:** `config.minLevel` (number, 0 = no level requirement)
- **Error Code:** `LEVEL_TOO_LOW`

**API Response:**
```json
{
  "statusCode": 403,
  "code": "LEVEL_TOO_LOW",
  "message": "This game requires Level 5",
  "required": 5,
  "current": 2,
  "offset": 3
}
```

#### 6. budgetConfig (Budget Control)
- **Purpose:** Control total value of prizes issued daily/monthly
- **Use Case:** Cost control, prevent marketing budget overflow
- **Config Field:**
  ```typescript
  budgetConfig: {
    enable: boolean;
    dailyBudget: number;   // Daily budget
    monthlyBudget: number; // Monthly budget
  }
  ```
- **Error Code:** `DAILY_BUDGET_EXCEEDED`, `MONTHLY_BUDGET_EXCEEDED`
- **Data Recording:** Recorded to the `budget_tracking` table after every win

**How to use:**
- Add the `cost` field in `prizeList` configuration:
  ```json
  {
    "icon": "💎",
    "label": "Grand Prize",
    "weight": 10,
    "value": 1000,
    "cost": 100  // This prize costs 100
  }
  ```
- Backend will automatically track the total cost

### 🎮 Low Priority Rules (Phase 4)

#### 7. dynamicProbConfig (Dynamic Probability Adjustment)
- **Purpose:** Increase win probability after X consecutive losses (Pity mechanism)
- **Use Case:** Game balancing, player experience improvement
- **Config Field:**
  ```typescript
  dynamicProbConfig: {
    enable: boolean;
    lossStreakLimit: number;  // Triggered after X losses
    lossStreakBonus: number;  // Bonus probability percentage
  }
  ```

**Working Principle:**
- Frontend calls `getDynamicWeights()` when determining a prize
- Backend analyzes the last 10 game records
- If the loss streak hits the threshold, adjust weights:
  - Loss prize weight × 0.5
  - Win prize weight × (1 + bonus%)

**Example:**
```typescript
// Original weights: [40, 20, 30, 10]
// After 3 losses: [40*1.2, 20*1.2, 30*0.5, 10*1.2] = [48, 24, 15, 12]
```

#### 8. vipTiers (VIP Privileges)
- **Purpose:** VIP members enjoy extra attempts and reward multipliers
- **Use Case:** Member differentiation, increased incentive to pay
- **Config Field:**
  ```typescript
  vipTiers: [
    { name: "Bronze", extraSpins: 0, multiplier: 1 },
    { name: "Silver", extraSpins: 1, multiplier: 1.2 },
    { name: "Gold", extraSpins: 2, multiplier: 1.5 },
    { name: "Platinum", extraSpins: 5, multiplier: 2 }
  ]
  ```

**Effect:**
- **extraSpins:** Increases daily game attempts
  - Standard User: `dailyLimit` = 3
  - Gold VIP: `dailyLimit` = 3 + 2 = 5
- **multiplier:** Reward points multiplier
  - Base score: 10
  - Gold VIP: 10 × 1.5 = 15

**How to set VIP:**
```sql
UPDATE members SET vip_tier = 'Gold' WHERE id = 'user-id';
```

### ✅ All Rules Implemented!

**Phase 1+2 (High Priority):** dailyLimit, cooldown, oneTimeOnly, timeLimitConfig  
**Phase 3 (Medium Priority):** minLevel, budgetConfig  
**Phase 4 (Low Priority):** dynamicProbConfig, vipTiers

**Status:** Backend code complete ✅  
**Next Step:** Testing/Verification (See `minigame/TESTING-PLAN.md`)

## 🎁 Prizes & Metadata System

**Implementation Date:** 2026-02-14  
**Primary Features:** Flexible prize types, points calibration, automatic metadata enrichment, human-friendly tags

### 📍 Location
- **Backend Service:** `apps/api/src/modules/scores/scores.service.ts` (Issuance logic)
- **Backend Entities:** 
  - `apps/api/src/modules/prizes/entities/prize-type.entity.ts`
  - `apps/api/src/modules/scores/entities/score.entity.ts`
- **Game Templates:** 
  - `apps/api/src/modules/game-instances/templates/spin-wheel.template.ts`
  - `apps/api/src/modules/game-instances/game-instances.controller.ts` (V1 Template)
- **Frontend Views:**
  - `apps/soybean-admin/src/views/games/scores/index.vue`
  - `apps/soybean-admin/src/views/games/member-detail/[id].vue`

### 🎯 Feature Description

This system handles prize issuance, distinguishes between different prize natures (points-based vs. non-points-based), and automatically enriches winning metadata to ensure admin panel data is clear and professional.

### ⚙️ Core Mechanisms

#### 1. Flexible Prize Types
- **isPoints Property**: `PrizeType` entity added `isPoints` field.
- **Issuance Logic**: `ScoresService.submit()` checks the prize type.
  - `isPoints: true` (e.g., Points): `finalPoints = winningScore`, credited to member balance and stats.
  - `isPoints: false` (e.g., Item, Cash): `finalPoints = 0`, records the win but does not affect points balance.
- **Problem Solved**: Prevents physical prizes (e.g., iPhone) from being incorrectly summed into the member's "Total Points".

#### 2. Automatic Metadata Enrichment
- **Problem**: Clients sometimes send empty `metadata.prize`, leading to incomplete admin logs.
- **Solution**: Backend `ScoresService` implements multi-layer fallback logic:
  ```typescript
  metadata.prize = label || prizeName || type || prizeType || 'Win';
  ```
- **Working Principle**: Regardless of client input, the backend ensures descriptive prize names are stored.

#### 3. Human-Friendly Tags
- **Frontend Transformation**: Admin UI converts raw JSON metadata into readable color-coded Tags.
- **Interaction**: Click or hover on tags to view full JSON details.
- **Display Content**: Automatically identifies and displays "Winner", "Multiplier", "Deduction", "Item Name", etc.

#### 4. Professional Table Layout
- **Anti-Wrap Dates**: Time column fixed at **200px** width with `whitespace-nowrap`.
- **Fixed Layout**: Time column remains fixed on the left during horizontal scrolling.

### 🚨 Modification Impact Scope
- **Statistics Logic**: Modifying `isPoints` directly affects global dashboard and member detail point calculations.
- **Game Templates**: Modifying `labels` generation logic in templates affects new Score records.

## 📊 Score History UI System

**Implementation Date:** 2026-02-14  
**Status:** Live ✅

### 📍 Location
- **Frontend View:** `apps/soybean-admin/src/views/games/scores/index.vue`
- **API Interface:** `Api.Management.Score`

### 🎯 Feature Description
The Score History UI provides a transparent and reliable breakdown of every game transaction. It moves away from a single "Points" column to a detailed financial ledger view.

### ⚙️ Column Structure

#### 1. Base Value & Multiplier
- **Base Value**: The raw score from the game.
- **Multiplier**: Applied multiplier (e.g., VIP tier).
- **Formula**: `Final Award = Base Value * Multiplier`.

#### 2. Final Award vs Cost
- **Final Award**: The *gross* points awarded to the player. Displayed in **Blue/Green** (e.g., `+500`).
- **Cost**: The cost to play the round. Displayed in **Red** (e.g., `-20`).
- **Net Profit**: User can easily calculate `Final - Cost`.

### 🎨 Visual Language
- **🏆 Jackpot/Big Win**: Gold/Orange tags.
- **📦 Physical Prize**: Green tags with Box icon.
- **🪙 Points/Coins**: Default styling.
- **Try Again**: Grayed out to reduce noise.

## 👥 Member Management System

**Implementation Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Status:** Fully Functional 🟢

### 📍 Location
- **Backend Controller:** `apps/api/src/modules/members/admin-members.controller.ts`
- **Backend Service:** `apps/api/src/modules/members/members.service.ts`
- **Frontend List:** `apps/soybean-admin/src/views/management/member/index.vue`
- **Frontend Detail:** `apps/soybean-admin/src/views/management/member/detail.vue`
- **API Service:** `apps/api/src/service/api/management.ts`

### 🎯 Feature Description
Manages all registered members and guests. Supports viewing member details, point history, play records, login history, and manual point adjustments or account enabling/disabling.

### ⚙️ Core Features
1. **Unified ID System**: Uses UUID (String) as the unique identifier for members, ensuring compatibility across multiple platforms and 3rd party integrations.
2. **Status Toggle**: Supports instant enabling or disabling of member accounts via the `isActive` field.
3. **Points Management**: Allows admins to manually add/subtract points with mandatory reason fields; all operations are logged in the database and audit trail.
4. **Multidimensional History**:
   - Credit Transaction History
   - Play History
   - Score Records
   - Login Footprints

### 🚨 Modification Impact Scope
- **API Auth**: Disabled members cannot obtain tokens or perform external validation.
- **Game Rules**: Rule validation checks member status.
- **Audit Logic**: All critical modifications trigger audit logging.

## 🎭 Admin Impersonation System

**Implementation Date:** 2026-02-20  
**Status:** Live ✅

### 📍 Location
- **Backend Auth:** `apps/api/src/modules/auth/auth.service.ts`
- **Backend Members:** `apps/api/src/modules/members/admin-members.controller.ts`
- **Game Rules:** `apps/api/src/modules/scores/game-rules.service.ts`
- **Scores Service:** `apps/api/src/modules/scores/scores.service.ts`
- **Frontend UI:** `apps/web-app/src/views/game/index.vue`

### 🎯 Feature Description
Allows administrators to securely log in as a member to test game functionality and preview configurations. The system enforces strict "read-only" protection to ensure that administrative tests do not pollute production databases or user balances.

### ⚙️ Core Mechanisms

#### 1. Identity Token Generation
- An administrator triggering the impersonate action generates a special JWT for the member.
- This JWT includes an `isImpersonated: true` flag in its payload.

#### 2. Strict Bypass Rules
When the `isImpersonated` flag is detected by the API:
- **Status Checks**: `GameRulesService.getPlayerStatus` overrides blocks (e.g., `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE`, `DAILY_LIMIT_REACHED`) to return `canPlay: true`.
- **Game Validation**: `ScoresService.submit` bypasses standard validation rules, allowing the game to proceed regardless of the member's eligibility.
- **No Persistence**: Score results are not saved to the database. Instead of a real score ID, the API returns a mock ID (`impersonated-test-id`). Points balances and play history are completely untouched.

#### 3. Visual Warnings
- The Web App frontend reads the `isImpersonated` flag from the decoded JWT.
- If true, it displays a highly visible pulsing red banner: **"ADMIN IMPERSONATION MODE: No tokens will be deducted and points will not be saved."**

### 🚨 Modification Impact Scope
- **Game Logic**: Any new game rules or point deduction logic implemented in `ScoresService` MUST verify the `isImpersonated` flag to prevent accidental alterations to user data during testing.

## 🔒 PII Masking & Privacy System

**Implementation Date:** 2026-02-19  
**Status:** Live ✅

### 📍 Location
- **Utils:** `apps/api/src/common/utils/masking.utils.ts`
- **Backend Controllers:** 
  - `MembersController` (Client/Public)
  - `AdminMembersController` (Admin List/Detail)
  - `AdminScoresController` (Score/Attempt Lists)
- **Frontend Modules:** `apps/soybean-admin/src/views/games/members/modules/operate-drawer.vue`
- **Permission:** `members:view_sensitive` (Added via Seed)

### 🎯 Feature Description
Enhances user data privacy by masking sensitive Personal Identifiable Information (PII) such as email addresses and phone numbers. Masking is applied by default in all list views and is conditionally lifted only for authorized personnel in detail views.

### ⚙️ Core Mechanisms

#### 1. Default Masking Strategy
- **Email**: `user****@domain.com` (Keeps first 4 chars of local part).
- **Phone**: `*******1234` (Keeps last 4 digits).
- **Scope**: Applied to ALL list views (Member List, Score List, Play Attempts) for ALL users.

#### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Permission**: `members:view_sensitive`.
- **Logic**:
    - **List Views**: Always masked.
    - **Detail/Edit Views**: 
        - If User has `members:view_sensitive` (e.g., Super Admin) → Show **Unmasked** data.
        - If User lacks permission (e.g., Staff) → Show **Masked** data.

#### 3. Safe Edit Protection
- **Problem**: If a Staff member edits a user with masked data (e.g., Phone: `*******1234`) and saves, the database might be overwritten with asterisks.
- **Solution**:
    1. **Fetch Fresh Data**: The Edit form (`operate-drawer.vue`) fetches a fresh copy of member data upon opening, ensuring it doesn't rely on the potentially masked list row data.
    2. **Submission Guard**: Before submitting, the frontend checks if the value contains `****`. If so, it **removes** that field from the payload, telling the backend "Do not update this field".

### 🚨 Modification Impact Scope
- **Export**: Export features must explicitly handle unmasking if full data is required for reports.
- **Search**: Searching by full phone number might fail if the frontend tries to filter masked data client-side. Server-side search is recommended.

## 🎮 Game Frontend (web-app)

### 1. Game Iframe Container

#### 📍 Location
- **Main File:** `apps/web-app/src/views/game/index.vue`
- **Related Files:**
  - `store/auth.ts` - User authentication
  - `store/settings.ts` - Audio settings
  - `service/api.ts` - API calls

#### 🎯 Feature Description
The primary container for games, loading the actual game engine via iframe. Handles:
- Game instance loading
- User authentication and token validation
- Fullscreen mode
- Audio control (header and floating button)
- Loading state and error handling

#### ⚙️ Configuration (from game instance)
- `showSoundButton` (boolean, default: true) - Show floating audio button
- `soundButtonOpacity` (number 0-100, default: 80) - Audio button opacity
- `hideHeader` (query param) - Hide top header

#### 🔗 Dependencies
**Depends on:**
- `authStore` - Get user token
- `settingsStore` - Audio toggle state
- API endpoint: `/api/game-instances/:slug/play` - Get game URL

**Referenced by:**
- Router (`/game/:id`) - Navigation to the game page

#### 🔧 Working Principle
1. Get game instance slug from route params
2. Call API to get game configuration and iframe URL
3. Validate user token (if login required)
4. Load game engine in iframe
5. Provide audio control and fullscreen button
6. `postMessage` communication (if required by game engine)

#### 📊 Data Flow
```
Route (/game/:id) 
  → API (/api/game-instances/:slug)
  → Fetch game config
  → Build iframe URL
  → Iframe loads game engine
  → postMessage communication (set token, etc.)
```

#### 🐛 FAQs
1. **Problem:** Iframe fails to load
   **Reason:** Game instance doesn't exist or is not published
   **Solution:** Check slug correctness, check instance status

2. **Problem:** Audio button not showing
   **Reason:** `showSoundButton` configured as false
   **Solution:** Edit game instance in Admin Panel → Effects tab → Enable audio button

#### 🚨 Modification Impact Scope
- **Route Access**: Affects any page relying on Game Instance or Admin features logic.
- **Component Styling**: Any future global style changes might affect iframe boundary rules.

## 🎨 Theme Editor Visuals Alignment

**Implementation Date:** 2026-02-21  
**Status:** Live ✅

### 📍 Location
- **Frontend Editor:** `apps/soybean-admin/src/views/games/theme-detail/index.vue`
- **Backend Schema:** `apps/api/src/modules/seed/seed.service.ts`

### 🎯 Feature Description
Aligns the Theme Editor's visual styling capabilities with the deeper Game Instance configuration, allowing themes to fully bundle core structural visual assets and sound effects.

### ⚙️ Core Mechanisms

#### 1. Standardized Upload Patterns
All image and audio inputs within `theme-detail/index.vue` have been refactored to utilize a consistent readonly input display. This pattern extracts the filename using `getAssetFilename` and offers explicit suffix buttons:
- 👁️ **Preview**: Opens the asset in `NModal`.
- 🗑️ **Clear**: Removes the asset from `formData.config`.
- 📁 **Upload**: Triggers the `triggerUpload` native file selector.

#### 2. Expanded Schema Properties
The `visuals` tab schema within the backend (`seed.service.ts`) was flattened to include standard sound effects alongside new properties, which the Theme Editor (`ThemeConfig`) now explicitly mirrors:
- **Audio**: `bgmUrl`, `winSound`, `loseSound`, `jackpotSound`
- **Structure**: `dividerImage`, `centerImage`, `tokenBarImage`
- **Result Prompts (Win/Lose/Jackpot)**: Backgrounds, title images, and button images.
- **Gradient Direction**: Standardized from manual degrees to strict semantic dropdown options.

### 🚨 Modification Impact Scope
- **Theme Data**: Themes can now independently supply comprehensive 'reskins', including unique outcome sounds and modal backgrounds, reducing the configuration burden on individual Game Instances.
**Modifying this file affects:**
- ✅ Game loading flow
- ✅ Audio control UI
- ✅ Fullscreen functionality
- ❌ Does not affect: Actual game logic (inside iframe)

**Requires Rebuild:**
- `web-app` frontend

**Requires Test:**
- Visit `/game/:slug` to test game loading
- Test audio button display and functionality
- Test fullscreen mode

---

### 2. Floating Status Display

**Implementation Date:** 2026-02-01

#### 📍 Location
- **Main File:** `apps/web-app/src/views/game/index.vue`
- **API Endpoint:** `GET /api/scores/status/:instanceSlug`
- **Backend Service:** `apps/api/src/modules/scores/game-rules.service.ts` → `getPlayerStatus()`

#### 🎯 Feature Description
Displays a floating status card at the top-left of the game page, showing real-time player status, remaining attempts, time limits, cooldowns, etc. Supports collapse/expand; colors change based on status (Red=blocked, Yellow=warning, Blue/Purple=normal).

**Live Preview Support** - Admin can see full status information in the preview interface while configuring games.

#### 🎨 Display Content

**1. One Time Only Warning**
- Display: ⚠️ One Time Only (Used)
- Condition: `gameStatus.oneTimeOnly === true`
- If already played: Displays "(Used)" tag (Red)

- Displayed inside a red warning box
- All text in English:
  - "Level too low! Need Lv5"
  - "Event not started yet"
  - "Event has ended"
  - "Not available today"
  - "Already played (one time only)"
  - "No attempts left today"

#### 🔘 Collapsed Button
- Small circular button with information icon
- Color states:
  - **Red (danger):**
    - `canPlay === false` (any block reason)
    - `oneTimeOnly && hasPlayedEver`
    - `!isInActiveTime` (outside time range)
    - `remaining === 0` (attempts exhausted)
  - **Yellow (warning):**
    - `cooldownRemaining > 0`
    - `remaining === 1`
  - **Purple (normal):** Normal state

#### 📊 API Response Structure

**Full Backend Status Response:**
```json
{
  "canPlay": false,
  "dailyLimit": 5,
  "played": 5,
  "remaining": 0,
  "resetAt": "2026-02-02T00:00:00.000Z",
  "blockReason": "ALREADY_PLAYED",
  "blockDetails": {
    "message": "You have already played this game, only one attempt allowed per person"
  },
  "oneTimeOnly": true,
  "hasPlayedEver": true,
  "timeLimitConfig": {
    "enable": true,
    "startTime": "09:00",
    "endTime": "21:00",
    "activeDays": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  },
  "isInActiveTime": false,
  "cooldownRemaining": 45
}
```

#### ⚙️ Frontend Implementation Details

**Computed Properties:**
```javascript
// Color of the collapsed button
collapsedButtonStatus = computed(() => {
  if (!canPlay && blockReason) return 'danger';
  if (oneTimeOnly && hasPlayedEver) return 'danger';
  if (!isInActiveTime) return 'danger';
  if (remaining === 0) return 'danger';
  if (cooldownRemaining > 0) return 'warning';
  if (remaining === 1) return 'warning';
  return 'normal';
});

// Attempts text color
remainingColor = computed(() => {
  if (remaining === 0) return '#ef4444'; // Red
  if (remaining === 1) return '#facc15'; // Yellow
  return 'white'; // Normal
});
```

**Helper Functions:**
```javascript
// Formatting time limit display
formatTimeLimit(config) {
  const dayNames = ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat'];
  const days = config.activeDays.map(d => dayNames[d]).join(', ');
  const time = `${config.startTime}-${config.endTime}`;
  return `${days} ${time}`;
}

// Formatting cooldown time
formatCooldown(seconds) {
  if (seconds < 60) return `${seconds}s`;
  const mins = Math.floor(seconds / 60);
  const secs = seconds % 60;
  return `${mins}:${secs.toString().padStart(2, '0')}`;
}
```

#### 🔄 Real-time Update Logic

**1. Initial Load:**
```javascript
onMounted(() => {
  fetchGameStatus(); // Initial fetch
  if (cooldownRemaining > 0) {
    startCooldownTimer(); // Start countdown
  }
});
```

**2. Cooldown Countdown:**
```javascript
cooldownInterval = setInterval(() => {
  if (cooldownRemaining.value > 0) {
    cooldownRemaining.value--;
    // Update game engine inside iframe
    postMessage({ type: 'game-status-update', cooldownRemaining });
  } else {
    clearInterval(cooldownInterval);
    fetchGameStatus(); // Re-fetch status
  }
}, 1000);
```

**3. Refresh Button:**
- Manually refresh status
- Animation: Button rotation

#### 🎯 Live Preview Support

**Significant Changes (2026-02-01):**
- ✅ **Removed `!isPreview` condition** - Status now displays in preview mode.
- ✅ **Admins can see full status in preview after logging in.**
- ✅ **Helps admins verify correct configuration.**

**Logic:**
```javascript
// Old Logic (Incorrect)
if (isPreview.value || !authStore.token) return;

// New Logic (Correct)
if (!authStore.token || !instanceSlug.value) return;
```

**Benefits:**
- Admin can see changes immediately in preview while editing configurations.
- No need to publish before testing.
- Real-time verification for "One Time Only", "Time Limit", and other critical rules.

#### 🌐 Internationalization (i18n)

**Frontend Consistently Uses English** (2026-02-01):
- All user-facing text is in English.
- Admin backend remains in Chinese for now.
- Future multi-language support will be implemented via an i18n framework.

**Text Mapping:**
```javascript
const ERROR_MESSAGES = {
  'LEVEL_TOO_LOW': 'Level too low! Need Lv{level}',
  'NOT_STARTED': 'Event not started yet',
  'ENDED': 'Event has ended',
  'INVALID_DAY': 'Not available today',
  'ALREADY_PLAYED': 'Already played (one time only)',
  'NO_ATTEMPTS_LEFT': 'No attempts left today',
  'COOLDOWN_ACTIVE': 'Cooldown: {time}'
};
```

#### 🔗 Communication with Game Engine

**postMessage to iframe:**
```javascript
iframeRef.contentWindow.postMessage({
  type: 'game-status-update',
  status: {
    canPlay: gameStatus.canPlay,
    blockReason: gameStatus.blockReason,
    cooldownRemaining: cooldownRemaining
  }
}, '*');
```

**Game Engine Reception:**
```javascript
window.addEventListener('message', (e) => {
  if (e.data.type === 'game-status-update') {
    const { canPlay, blockReason } = e.data.status;
    // Update Spin button state
    document.getElementById('spin-btn').disabled = !canPlay;
  }
});
```

#### 🐛 FAQs

**1. Problem: Status not visible in Preview mode**
- **Reason:** Old version had a `!isPreview` condition.
- **Solution:** Fixed (2026-02-01), rebuild `web-app`.

**2. Problem: Colors not displaying (White)**
- **Reason:** Inline styles were overridden by parent CSS.
- **Solution:** Use computed property + inline style (highest priority).

**3. Problem: Time limit shows Chinese**
- **Reason:** `dayNames` used a Chinese array.
- **Solution:** Changed to `['Sun', 'Mon', ...]`.

**4. Problem: Cooldown not counting down**
- **Reason:** Interval was not started or was cleared.
- **Solution:** Ensure `startCooldownTimer()` is called.

**5. Problem: API returns data but frontend doesn't display it**
- **Reason:** Frontend was not rebuilt.
- **Solution:** `docker compose build --no-cache web-app`.

#### 🚨 Modification Impact Scope

### 4. Game Configuration Form (ConfigForm) - 🔥 Most Complex

#### 📍 Location
- **Main File:** `apps/soybean-admin/src/views/management/game-instance/components/ConfigForm.vue`
- **Related Files:**
  - `locales/langs/zh-cn.ts` - Chinese translations.
  - `locales/langs/en-us.ts` - English translations.
  - `seed.service.ts` (API) - Schema definitions.

#### 🎯 Feature Description
**This is the most complex component in the entire Admin Panel!** It dynamically renders the game configuration form, supporting:
- Multi-tab layout (Prizes, Rules, Visuals & Interactions, Effects & Audio).
- Dynamic forms (generated based on the game template's schema).
- File uploads (images, audio, etc.).
- Color pickers.
- Probability calculation and automatic balancing.
- i18n multi-language support.

#### ⚙️ Schema Driven
ConfigForm's fields are **dynamically generated** based on the game template's schema:
```typescript
// From seed.service.ts
{
  name: 'showSoundButton',
  type: 'boolean',
  label: 'Show Sound Button',
  defaultValue: true,
  tab: 'effects'
}
```

#### 🔗 Dependencies

2. Iterates through the schema to generate form fields.
3. Renders different inputs (text/number/color/file, etc.) based on field type.
4. User edits → Updates `formModel`.
5. Click Save → Calls API to update config.
6. i18n: Uses `t('page.manage.game.common.fieldName')` to translate labels.

#### 📊 Data Flow
```
Load page
  → API: Get game template schema
  → Parse schema
  → Render form dynamically
  
User edits
  → Update formModel
  → (Auto-save or manual save)
  → API: Update game instance config
```

#### ✨ New Feature: Tab Validation Status Display (2026-02-01)
**Feature:** When a tab has a validation error, the tab label displays red text and an ❌ icon.

**Implementation:**
- Added `isTabValid(tabName)` function to check tab validation status.
- Prizes tab: Checks if total probability equals 100%.
- Invalid tab headers show red + ❌ icon.
- Users can instantly identify which tab needs correction.

**Code Location:**
- `ConfigForm.vue` line ~685 (`isTabValid` function).
- `ConfigForm.vue` line ~1033 (tab template conditional class).

**Extensibility:**
- Validation rules can be added for other tabs.
- Example: Rules tab checks `dailyLimit > 0`, Visuals tab checks color count, etc.

#### 🐛 FAQs
1. **Problem:** New configuration items not showing
   **Reason:** Schema not updated or Admin not rebuilt.
   **Solution:** Re-run `/api/seed/run` + rebuild `admin`.

2. **Problem:** Translations showing keys instead of text
   **Reason:** i18n definition missing or duplicate keys.
   **Solution:** Check `zh-cn.ts` and `en-us.ts`, ensure no duplicate object keys.

3. **Problem:** File upload fails
   **Reason:** File size too large or format unsupported.
   **Solution:** Check file size (<50MB) and MIME type.

#### 🚨 Modification Impact Scope
**Modifying ConfigForm.vue affects:**
- ✅ Configuration interface for all games.
- ✅ Form validation logic.
- ✅ File upload functionality.
- ❌ Does not affect: The game itself (only affects the configuration interface).

**Modifying seed.service.ts (schema) affects:**
- ✅ Fields rendered in `ConfigForm`.
- ✅ Default configurations for games.
- ✅ **Must rebuild both `api` and `admin`.**
- ✅ **Must re-run `/api/seed/run`.**

**Requires Rebuild:**
- `admin` frontend (any UI changes).
- `api` + `admin` (schema changes).

**Required Verification:**
- Edit a game instance.

### 5. i18n Translation System

#### 📍 Location
- **Configuration:** `apps/soybean-admin/src/locales/index.ts`
- **Translation Files:**
  - `locales/langs/zh-cn.ts` - Chinese.
  - `locales/langs/en-us.ts` - English.
- **Usage:** All Vue components via `{{ t('key') }}`.

#### 🎯 Feature Description
Multi-language support system allowing the interface to toggle between Chinese and English.

#### ⚙️ Configuration
- `locale` - Current language (`localStorage`: 'lang').
- `fallbackLocale` - Fallback language ('en-US').

#### 🔗 Dependencies
**Depends on:**
- `vue-i18n` - i18n library.
- Locale files - Translation definitions.

**Referenced by:**
- All components requiring translation.

#### 🔧 Working Principle
1. Initializes `i18n` during App setup.
2. Reads user's language preference from `localStorage`.
3. Components use `t('key')` to retrieve translations.
4. If a key doesn't exist, it returns the key itself (fallback).

#### 🐛 FAQs
1. **Problem:** Key displays instead of translation
   **Reason:** Translation key missing or typo.
   **Solution:** Check `zh-cn.ts` and `en-us.ts` to ensure the key exists.

2. **Problem:** Some translations are English, others Chinese
   **Reason:** Mixed locale settings or missing translations.
   **Solution:** Check current locale, provide missing translations.

3. **Problem:** Duplicate object keys causing translation overrides (2026-01-31 case)
   **Reason:** Two identical keys in the same object.
   **Solution:** Merge duplicate definitions.

#### 🚨 Modification Impact Scope
**Modifying translation files affects:**
- ✅ All interfaces using that key.
- ❌ Does not affect: Functional logic.

**Requires Rebuild:**
- `admin` frontend.

**Required Verification:**
- Toggle languages.
- Verify correct translations across all screens.
- Check for any displaying keys.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT RULES (2026-01-31 Lesson):**
1. Always check for existing duplicate keys.
2. Never define two identical keys in the same object.
3. Always update both `zh-cn.ts` and `en-us.ts` simultaneously.

#### 📍 Location
- **Main File:** `apps/api/src/modules/seed/seed.service.ts`
- **Controller:** `apps/api/src/modules/seed/seed.controller.ts`
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/seed/run`

#### 🎯 Feature Description
Defines and initializes Game Templates, including:
- Game types (Spin Wheel, Scratch Card, etc.).
- Schema definitions (types of config items, default values, validation rules).
- Default configuration.
- i18n keys.

**This is the "DNA" of the entire system!** The schema determines how `ConfigForm` renders.

#### ⚙️ Schema Structure
```typescript
interface SchemaItem {
  name: string;          // Configuration item name
  type: string;          // Type (string/number/boolean/color/file/array, etc.)
  label?: string;        // Display label (if not using i18n)
  i18nKey?: string;      // i18n key (preferred)
  defaultValue?: any;    // Default value
  tab: string;           // Tab category (prizes/rules/visuals/effects)
  required?: boolean;    // Is required
  validation?: object;   // Validation rules
}
```

#### 🔗 Dependencies
**Depends on:**
- Database - Stores game templates.
- TypeORM entities - `GameTemplate` entity.

**Referenced by:**
- `ConfigForm` - Reads schema to render forms.
- Game instances - Choose template on creation.

#### 🔧 Working Principle
1. Developer defines game templates in `seed.service.ts`.
2. Call `/api/seed/run` to initialize the database.
3. Templates are stored in the database.
4. `ConfigForm` reads the schema from the API.
5. Configuration form is rendered dynamically.

#### 🐛 FAQs
1. **Problem:** New configuration items do not show in Admin Panel
   **Reason:** Seed not re-run or Admin not rebuilt.
   **Solution:** 
     - Modify `seed.service.ts`.
     - Rebuild API.
     - Re-run `/api/seed/run`.
     - Rebuild Admin.
     - Refresh Admin Panel.

2. **Problem:** Old games show errors after Schema changes
   **Reason:** Old game configurations do not include new fields.
   **Solution:** Edit the old game once and save (it will append default values).

#### 🚨 Modification Impact Scope
**Modifying seed.service.ts affects:**
- ✅ Newly created game templates.
- ✅ `ConfigForm` structural layout.
- ✅ Default game configurations.
- ❌ Does not directly affect: Existing game instances (requires manual edit).

**Full Modification Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Modify seed.service.ts
vim apps/api/src/modules/seed/seed.service.ts

# 2. Rebuild API
docker compose build --no-cache api

# 3. Restart API
docker compose up -d api

# 4. Re-run seed
curl -X POST https://api.xseo.me/api/seed/run

# 5. Rebuild Admin (if schema structure changed)
docker compose build --no-cache admin
docker compose up -d admin

# 6. Verification
# - Create new game instance
# - Verify new configuration item shows
# - Verify translation is correct
```

**Required Verification:**
- Create new game instance.
- Verify all configuration items show.

  → Validate file
  → Save to uploads/{companyId}/{instanceId}/{category}/
  → Return file URL
  → ConfigForm updates config.fieldName
  → User saves game config
```

#### 🎵 Audio Upload Three-Mode System (New 2026-01-31) ⭐

**Feature:** Audio fields in `ConfigForm` support three modes with a complete UX experience.

**Three Modes:**

1. **🎵 Use Theme Default Audio**
   - Value: `__THEME_DEFAULT__` or `/templates/{theme}/audio.mp3`
   - Uses the current theme's default audio.
   - Automatically updates when the theme switches.
   - Does not consume user storage.
   - ✅ Includes Preview button (Play/Stop).

2. **📤 Custom Upload**
   - Value:
     - Not uploaded: `__CUSTOM_PENDING__` (internal placeholder, hidden from user).
     - Uploaded: `/api/uploads/{companyId}/{instanceId}/audio/{filename}`
   - Users upload their own audio files.
   - Stored in the user's private folder.
   - **Does not replace theme files.** ✅
   - ✅ Includes Preview button (available after upload).
   - ✅ Input displays friendly placeholder: "Please upload an audio file".

3. **🔇 Do Not Use Audio**
   - Value: Empty string `''` or `null`.
   - Completely disables this audio event.
   - Game engine skips playback.
   - ✅ **Hides volume/loop options** (User-Centric!).

**🎮 Complete UX Experience (Important!):**

1. **Preview Button Behavior:**
   - Click "Preview" → Play audio + Button becomes "⏸️ Stop".
   - Click again → Stop playback + Button reverts to "▶️ Preview".
   - Button auto-resets 1.5s after playback Ends.
   - **No overlapping playback**: Clicking another preview stops the current one.
   - State tracking: `audioPlayingStates` ref tracks each button's state.
   - Dynamic button text: Displays based on current state.

2. **Conditional Options (User-Centric):**
   - Select "Do Not Use Audio" → **Hides** volume and loop options.
     - Why: Avoids confusing users with useless options.
   - Select "Custom Upload" or "Use Theme" → **Shows** volume and loop options.
     - Shown even before upload (intent is to use audio).

3. **File Picker Audio Recognition:**
   - `accept` attribute: `audio/*,audio/mpeg,audio/wav,audio/ogg,audio/mp4,.mp3,.wav,.ogg,.m4a,.aac`
   - Provides both MIME types and file extensions (browser compatibility).
   - **Uses `nextTick()` before opening picker** (Critical for DOM updates).

**Implementation Details:**

1. **ConfigForm.vue Helper Functions:**
   
   **Audio Mode Management:**
   - `getAudioMode(key)` - **Real-time reactive mode derivation from formModel.**
     - ⚠️ No longer cached in `audioModes`; judged directly by current value.
     - Ensures UI updates instantly on radio switch.
   - `setAudioMode(key, mode)` - Sets mode and updates `formModel` value.
     - `none`: `''`
     - `theme`: `'__THEME_DEFAULT__'`
     - `custom`: `'__CUSTOM_PENDING__'` (pre-upload placeholder).
   - `getThemeAudioUrl(key)` - Fetches current theme's default audio URL.

   **Audio Preview Management:**
   - `currentAudio` - Current playing `HTMLAudioElement`.
   - `audioPlayingStates` ref - Tracks playing state for each button.
   - `toggleAudioPreview(key, url)` - Toggle play/stop.
     - If playing → Stop.
     - If another button is playing → Stop it first.
     - Play new audio + update button state.
     - Audio end → 1.5s auto-reset button.
   - `getPreviewButtonText(key, isTheme)` - Dynamic button text.
     - Playing: "⏸️ Stop"
     - Idle: "▶️ Preview Theme Audio" or "▶️ Preview"

   **File Upload:**
   - `async triggerUpload(key, name, category, item, accept)` - **Asynchronous!**
     - Sets `currentUploadTarget` (including `accept` attribute).
     - **`await nextTick()`** - Waits for Vue DOM update ⚠️ Critical!
     - Calls `click()` on file input.
     - Ensures `accept` attribute is updated so file picker recognizes formats.

   **Main Section Render (line 1229-1283):**
   - Handles top-level fields.
   - Radio group displays three options.
   - Conditional UI (custom mode shows upload button and preview).

   **⚠️ Nested Collapse-Group Render (line 1143-1199):**
   - **Audio fields are actually located here!** (`bgmUrl`, `winSound`, etc., inside collapse-groups).
   - Requires **copying full audio three-mode logic**.
   - Uses `subItem.key` instead of `item.key`.
   - **Bug Prevention:** When modifying audio field UI, both sections must be updated!

2. **Game Engine (`spin-wheel.template.ts`):**
   - `resolveAudioUrl(audioUrl, themeSlug, audioType)` - Resolves audio URL.
   - **Four Scenarios:**
     1. Empty string `''` → No audio played (User selected "None").
     2. `'__CUSTOM_PENDING__'` → No audio played (Custom selected but not yet uploaded).
     3. `'__THEME_DEFAULT__'` or `undefined` → Use theme default audio.
     4. Actual URL → Use user-uploaded audio.

3. **Upload API:**
   - Path structure: `uploads/{companyId}/{instanceId}/audio/`
   - Theme files: `uploads/templates/{theme}/`
   - **Completely isolated, no cross-impact.** ✅

**⚠️ Important: Audio Fields are in Collapse-Groups!**

Audio fields are defined in the seed schema within collapse-groups:
```typescript
{
  key: 'bgm_section',
  type: 'collapse-group',
  items: [
    { key: 'bgmUrl', type: 'file', ... },
    { key: 'bgmVolume', type: 'slider', ... }
  ]
}
```

This means:
- ✅ They are handled by nested render logic (line 1099-1155).
- ❌ They are not handled by the main section render (line 1229+).
- 🎯 **When modifying the audio UI, the collapse-group section must be updated!**

**File Storage Example:**
```
uploads/
  ├── templates/                    # Theme default files (not replaced)
  │   ├── cyberpunk-elite/
  │   │   ├── bgm.mp3
  │   │   ├── win.mp3
  │   │   └── lose.mp3
  │   └── neon-night/
  │       └── ...
  └── {companyId}/                  # User files
      └── {instanceId}/
          └── audio/                # User-uploaded audio
              ├── bgm.mp3
              ├── win.mp3
              └── jackpot.mp3
```

**Full Testing Checklist:**

1. **Three-Mode Toggle:**
   - ✅ Select "Use Theme Default" → **Instantly displays** Preview button.
   - ✅ Select "Custom Upload" → **Instantly displays** Upload button (no need to close/reopen collapse).
   - ✅ Select "Do Not Use Audio" → **Instantly hides** volume/loop options.

2. **Preview Button Experience:**
   - ✅ Click "Preview" → Play + Button becomes "⏸️ Stop".
   - ✅ Click again → Stop + Restore button.
   - ✅ Clicking the same button multiple times → No overlapping playback (toggle behavior).
   - ✅ Clicking another preview → Stops current playback, plays new one.
   - ✅ Playback end → Auto-restores button after 1.5 seconds.

3. **File Picker Test:**
   - ✅ Click "Upload audio file" → File picker only shows audio files.
   - ✅ Click "Upload image" → File picker only shows image files.
   - ✅ After successful upload → Input displays actual URL, not `__CUSTOM_PENDING__`.

4. **UX Verification:**
   - ✅ Custom mode before upload → Input shows placeholder "Please upload an audio file".
   - ✅ When audio unused → Volume/loop options hidden (avoids user confusion).
   - ✅ All operations are reactive, no refresh needed.

5. **Data Flow Verification:**
   - ✅ Theme switch → Default audio follows theme automatically.
   - ✅ After save → Game engine correctly plays corresponding audio.
   - ✅ Verify correct storage path for user files.

#### 🐛 FAQs and Solutions

1. **Problem:** Preview button causes overlapping playback.
   **Reason:** Every click created a `new Audio()` without stopping the previous one.
   **Solution:** ✅ Fixed - Using state tracking + `stop previous audio`.
   **Code:** `toggleAudioPreview()` function.

2. **Problem:** UI doesn't update after selecting radio button until closing/reopening collapse.
   **Reason:** `getAudioMode()` relied on cached `audioModes`, which was not reactive.
   **Solution:** ✅ Fixed - `getAudioMode()` now derives directly from `formModel`, making it fully reactive.
   **Code:** Line ~95 `getAudioMode()` always derives from current `formModel`.

3. **Problem:** File picker shows "Image Files" instead of audio files.
   **Reason:** Vue reactivity is asynchronous; the `click()` occurred before the `accept` attribute updated in the DOM.
   **Solution:** ✅ Fixed - Used `await nextTick()` to wait for DOM updates before calling `click()`.
   **Code:** `async triggerUpload()` + `await nextTick()`.

4. **Problem:** Input displays `__CUSTOM_PENDING__` to the user.
   **Reason:** Direct `v-model` binding with `formModel` exposed the internal value.
   **Solution:** ✅ Fixed - Used `:value` computed; displays empty string if `pending`.
   **Code:** `:value="formModel[key] === '__CUSTOM_PENDING__' ? '' : formModel[key]"`

5. **Problem:** Conditionally hidden volume options not taking effect.
   **Reason:** Seed schema conditions added, but existing instances were not refreshed.
   **Solution:** ✅ Run data seeder refresh - `PATCH /api/seed/refresh-schemas`.
   **Code:** `SeedService.refreshGameSchemas()`.

6. **Problem:** Upload failed - 413 Payload Too Large.
   **Reason:** File exceeds 50MB.
   **Solution:** Compress file or select a smaller file.

7. **Problem:** Upload failed - 415 Unsupported Media Type.
   **Reason:** Unsupported file format.
   **Solution:** Convert the file format.

8. **Problem:** File upload successful but not visible in game.
   **Reason:** Incorrect URL path or no public access.
   **Solution:** Verify file URL and ensure it is publicly accessible.

#### 🚨 Modification Impact Scope

**Modifying the audio three-mode logic affects:**
- ✅ `ConfigForm` - UI and behavior for all audio fields.
- ✅ Game Engine - Audio URL resolution and playback.
- ✅ Seed Service - Schema definitions and refresh logic.
- ✅ User Experience - All audio configuration operations.

**Requires Rebuild:**
- `admin` frontend (`ConfigForm` changes).
- `api` backend (template changes).

**Required Verification:**
- ✅ UI reactivity on mode switch.
- ✅ Preview button behavior (play/stop/auto-reset).
- ✅ File picker recognition of file types.
- ✅ Conditional option display/hide.
- ✅ Post-upload data flow.
- ✅ Correct audio playback in game engine.
- ✅ Refresh schemas applied to existing instances.

**User-Centric Principles Applied:**
- No internal values (`__CUSTOM_PENDING__`) shown to users.
- Use of friendly placeholder text.
- Hidden irrelevant options (e.g., hiding volume if audio is disabled).
- Complete interaction flow (Preview allows play and stop).
- Prevention of annoying behaviors (e.g., overlapping playback).
- Immediate reactive feedback (no reopen required).

- Each role has distinct permissions.
- Users are assigned roles.
- API endpoints protected based on permissions.

#### ⚙️ Permission Model
```typescript
Role {
  id: string;
  name: string;         // 'admin', 'editor', 'viewer'
  permissions: [];      // ['game:create', 'game:edit', 'member:view']
}

User {
  id: string;
  roles: Role[];        // A user can have multiple roles
}
```

#### 🔗 Dependencies
**Depends on:**
- Auth system - Verifies user identity.
- Role/Permission entities.
- JWT token - Contains user roles.

**Referenced by:**
- Protected API endpoints.
- Admin Panel - UI feature visibility.

#### 🔧 Working Principle

**Permission Check Flow:**
1. User accesses protected endpoint.
2. `AuthGuard` validates token.
3. `PermissionGuard` checks user permissions.
4. If authorized → Allow access.
5. If unauthorized → Return 403 Forbidden.

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
@Post()
@Roles('admin', 'editor')
@RequirePermission('game:create')
async createGame() {
  // Only admin and editor with game:create permission can access
}
```

#### 📊 Common Permission Types

## 🎨 Confetti Effect Configuration System (Added 2026-01-31)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Emoji + Paper Layering (Fixed 2026-01-31)**

Emoji and confetti are **overlaid**, not mutually exclusive!

**Correct Behavior:**
- Select "Default Paper" → Only displays colored paper confetti.
- Select "Emoji" → Colored paper + Emoji (both together!).

**Implementation Logic:**
```javascript
// ALWAYS fire paper confetti (base layer)
confetti({ colors: colors, particleCount: 150 });

// IF emoji mode, ALSO fire emoji (overlay - 40% particles)
if (emojiMode) {
    confetti({ shapes: emojiShapes, particleCount: 60 });
}
```

**Why Layering:**
- Paper = Primary effect (rich, full).
- Emoji = Decorative effect (theme, fun).
- Both together = Optimal visual experience.

### 📍 Location
**Admin Panel:**
- `ConfigForm.vue` - `color-list` and `emoji-list` type rendering.

}

function removeColor(key: string, index: number) {
  // Remove color from list
}

function updateColor(key: string, index: number, color: string) {
  // Update color at index
}

// Render
<NColorPicker 
  :value="color" 
  @update:value="(val) => updateColor(key, index, val)"
/>
```

**2. ConfigForm UI (`emoji-list` type):**
```typescript
// Helper Functions
const presetEmojis = ['🎉', '🎊', ...]; // 20 preset emojis

function toggleEmoji(key: string, emoji: string) {
  // Toggle emoji selection (max 10)
  // Add if not selected, remove if selected
}

function isEmojiSelected(key: string, emoji: string): boolean {
  // Check if emoji is in the list
}

// Render logic
<div 
  v-for="emoji in presetEmojis"

## 💰 Budget Tracking System

**Implementation Date:** 2026-02-14  
**Primary Features:** Real-time budget tracking, multi-level budget checks (Daily/Monthly), and "Soft Landing" for budget exhaustion.

### 📍 Location
- **Backend Service:** `apps/api/src/modules/scores/scores.service.ts`
- **Backend Entity:** `apps/api/src/modules/scores/entities/budget-ledger.entity.ts`
- **Frontend Dashboard:** `apps/soybean-admin/src/views/games/budget-tracking/index.vue`

### 🎯 Feature Description
The Budget Tracking System safeguards marketing budgets by tracking the monetary value of issued prizes in real-time. It supports both Daily and Monthly budget limits per game instance.

### ⚙️ Core Mechanisms

#### 1. Real-Time Tracking (Double-Entry Ledger)
- Every monetary prize (Cash, E-Gift, Physical Item) creates a `BudgetLedger` entry.
- **Cost vs. Value:** The system tracks the `cost` (budget impact) separate from the `value` (face value).
- **Points Exclusion:** Points-based prizes do NOT deduct from the budget.

#### 2. Multi-Level Budget Checks
Before every spin, the system performs a cascading check:
1. **Daily Limit:** Is `today_spent + prize_cost > daily_budget`?
2. **Monthly Limit:** Is `month_spent + prize_cost > monthly_budget`?
3. **Global Safety:** Is the prize cost realistic?

#### 3. Soft Landing (Social Mode)
- **Constraint:** We cannot simply "stop" the game when budget runs out (bad UX).
- **Solution:** When budget is exhausted, the game switches to **Social Mode**.
- **Behavior in Social Mode:**
  - Token deduction continues (Game acts as a "sink").
  - **NO monetary prizes** are awarded.
  - **Visual Masking:** All monetary prizes are visually transformed into "Score Rewards" or "XP Points".
  - **Leaderboard Only:** Players compete for ranking, not value.

---

## 🎭 Social Mode (Visual Prize Masking)

**Implementation Date:** 2026-02-14  
**Primary Features:** Dynamic frontend transformation of prizes when in "Social Mode" or "Budget Exhausted" state.

### 📍 Location
- **Backend Logic:** `apps/api/src/modules/game-instances/game-instances.controller.ts` (`maskPrizesForSocialMode`)
- **Frontend Template:** `apps/api/uploads/games/spin-wheel-premium-neon.html` (`maskPrizes`)

### 🎯 Feature Description
Prevents user frustration and confusion when the budget is exhausted. Instead of showing "Out of Stock" or "Error", the game seamlessly transforms into a "Play for Fun/Rank" mode.

### ⚙️ Core Mechanisms

#### 1. Universal Prize Masking
- **Trigger:** Budget Exhausted AND `exhaustionMode: 'soft'`.
- **Transformation Logic:**
  - **Target:** Any prize where `isPoints` is `false`.
  - **Label Change:** "Amazon $50" → "500 PTS" (Uses `cost` or `value` as points).
  - **Icon Change:** "🎁" → "⭐" (Score Icon).
  - **Type Change:** Effectively treated as a score-only reward.

#### 2. Backend + Frontend Synchronization
- **Backend:** Enriches config with `isPoints` flags and performs masking on the configuration object before sending to client.
- **Frontend:** Monitors game status real-time. If it detects "Social Mode", it applies a CSS/DOM overlay to mask prizes on the wheel/grid.

#### 3. "Leaderboard Only" UI Hints
- Displays "PLAY FOR RANKING" instead of "PLAY TO WIN".
- Hides monetary value indicators.
